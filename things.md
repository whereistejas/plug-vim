# Vim = Vi+Improved

1. What's `vi`?
	`vi` is a text editor. It was originally written in 1976, for the 
	first BSD release. The main goal was to add a full-screen visual
	mode to the famous single-line `ex` editor. `vi` is defined by the
	UNIX standard, and thus, every conforming OS has `vi`.
2. What is `vim`?
	It's a `vi` clone but with a lot of improvements.
3. What is `neovim`?
	`Neovim` is a refactoring of `vim`. It has a lot of cool features
	such as internal terminal support and asynchronous capabilities.
